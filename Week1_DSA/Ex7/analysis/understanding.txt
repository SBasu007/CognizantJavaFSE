1. Big O Notation is a mathematical way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm, its time complexity and space complexity, as the size of the input increases.
2a. Linear Search:
        Best-case: O(1)
        Worst-case: O(n)
        Avg-case: O(n)
2b. Binary Search:
        Best-case: O(1)
        Worst-case: O(log n)
        Avg-case: O(log n)
