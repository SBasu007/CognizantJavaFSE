1. Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
    The recursive method has a time complexity of O(n), as it makes one recursive call per year.

2. Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
    This is a simple recursive solution, hence optimisation is not necessary in this particular instance.
    Optimization can be done using memoization (caching results) or by converting to an iterative approach.
